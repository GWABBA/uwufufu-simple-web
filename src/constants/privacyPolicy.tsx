We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization, however, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which UwUFUFU participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of UwUFUFU 's assets to which this Website relates.



###Links to Third Party Sites/Opt-Out for Non-Personal Information Collection for Network Services

We use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit our Website, as well as to provide augmented website functionality and do data analyses in aggregate. These, and other companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number, but including your company name and job title gathered from your profile information) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
They may do this by using cookies and web beacons, among other things.
(See, e.g., <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacons>.) Some third parties might use the [DoubleClick DART cookie](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/enterprise/) in in the ads served on the Website.
When users visit the Website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help better serve and manage ads on our Website.
Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by cookie by visiting their advertising opt-out page. . . Platform-A, our advertising partner, may also utilize cookies to present more relevant ads.
If you would prefer to opt out, please visit their privacy policy and opt-out page. We may use Google AdSense, and so the privacy policies \\pertaining to Google AdSense ads are integrated herein by reference.
Users are encouraged to read the Google AdSense privacy policies here: [privacy ads](https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html), and the DoubleClick privacy policies here: [www.google.com/doubleclick/privacy/](https://www.google.com/doubleclick/privacy/).
Although we may attempt to contractually limit what third party advertising companies and networks do, we have no ability to monitor or control what they do. Recently some advertising companies and networks have been sued for allegedly using what are called local shared objects or re-spawning cookies (including by using Adobe® flash cookies). Although we attempt to contractually require that these companies shall always allow the end-user (you) to easily and completely uninstall any means of tracking the end-user without regenerating the means of such tracking, we cannot assure that this will occur and, therefore, you consent to these types of practices.
If you would like more information about what many advertising companies and advertising networks do and to know some of your choices about not having this information used by the companies that are member of the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit <https://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>.
